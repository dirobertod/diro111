After doing some research, I found a website called Arcade Academy that host a lot of information about different python based games and is a wealth of knowledge regarding the arcade library that many python-based games use. It also has a lot of educational information for implementing the arcade library as well as several guides too creating your own code using these resources. Like the stats library that allows for advanced math related functionality, the arcade library is used to provide many of the necessary physics of gameplay and the interface that you see above in the screenshot. 
	For my project, I would like to start by getting this code running on my local machine and then begin to investigate the code for opportunities to customize and improve upon the existing code. I would like to see what modifications you can make, not only to the interface but to the physics of the game as well. I think there is an opportunity to design several different types of games or levels, from modifying the existing code. I think this existing code is a fun experience and building on this experience can only make it a better one.
