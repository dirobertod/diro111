Asteroid Smasher
================

Asteroid Smasher is my final project for Intro to Game Design and Development (taken Fall 2013 @ San Jacinto College).
It is a simple 2D shooter game written in [Python 3.3.2] (http://www.python.org/getit/) using the [Pygame 1.9.1 library](http://pygame.org/download.shtml). 



To launch the game, run the launcher.bat script or navigate to the ```src/``` directory and run the ```AsteroidSmasher.py``` file.



Sound effects were generated with [BFXR](http://www.bfxr.net/)

Image assets were created with [Paint.net](http://www.getpaint.net/)


Music is [procedurally generated](http://abundant-music.com/).
